# GoodEmployers Project Report Update

## Project Overview

The GoodEmployers application is a client-server system designed to track GPS coordinates from multiple clients. The system consists of an Android client application built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, and a server component implemented with Python and FastAPI.

## Recent Updates and Improvements

### Android Client Fixes

We have addressed several compilation issues in the Android client:

1. **Configuration Files**
   - Added missing settings.gradle file
   - Updated gradle.properties with proper Android configuration
   - Ensured build.gradle files are properly configured

2. **Resource Files**
   - Added missing resource files (strings.xml, themes.xml, colors.xml, dimens.xml)
   - Created necessary XML configuration files (data_extraction_rules.xml, backup_rules.xml)
   - Added launcher icon resources

3. **Gradle Configuration**
   - Updated Gradle wrapper properties
   - Restored Gradle wrapper scripts
   - Ensured compatibility between Gradle plugin version and Kotlin version

### Build Requirements

The Android client requires a proper Java development environment:
- JDK 17 or newer
- Android SDK Platform 34
- Android Build Tools 34.0.0 or newer
- Properly configured JAVA_HOME environment variable

Detailed setup instructions are provided in the `java_environment_note.md` file.

## System Architecture

The system architecture remains unchanged:

1. **Android Client**
   - Collects GPS coordinates every 60 seconds
   - Sends data to server via REST API
   - Provides user authentication and status monitoring

2. **Server Component**
   - Receives and stores location data from clients
   - Provides API endpoints for data retrieval and visualization
   - Includes web interface for route visualization using Leaflet.js
   - Implements comprehensive logging system

## Deployment

The server can be deployed using the provided scripts:
```
cd server
chmod +x start_server.sh
./start_server.sh
```

The Android client must be built in a proper Android development environment as detailed in the Java environment setup documentation.

## Testing

The system has been tested with:
- Multiple simultaneous client connections
- Scalability testing with concurrent requests
- Verification of logging functionality
- API endpoint validation

## Next Steps

1. Complete GitHub repository setup
2. Ensure all documentation is up-to-date
3. Consider CI/CD pipeline for automated builds
4. Explore cloud deployment options for the server component
